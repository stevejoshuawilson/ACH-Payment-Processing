      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

16. Key risks

16.1 Unauthorised transactions: There is a risk your account or a transaction may be compromised and subject to a takeover, interception, or other type of fraudulent or unauthorised activity.

Your liability for unauthorised transactions

You are responsible for losses arising from an unauthorised transaction where we can prove, on the balance of probability, that you contributed to a loss through fraud or breaching our password and PIN security requirements. You will be liable in full for the actual losses that occur before the loss, theft or misuse of a security key or breach of password or PIN security is reported to us.

16.2 Recovering owed funds: There is a risk you may:

not receive your payment where you owe any amount to us, our Related Bodies Corporate or eBay; or
incur bank fees if your payment method has insufficient funds to complete your payment with us.
Recovering owed funds

When you receive a payment through our services, usually we have not yet received payment in full from the sender. From the time that you receive the payment, you will owe us an amount equivalent to the amount of the transaction (including any applicable fees imposed on us), and that liability will be cancelled only when we receive irrevocable payment in full. Events that could lead to us not receiving payment in full include:

The funds received being later invalidated for any reason;
The funds received being subject to a chargeback (determined by the sender’s card issuer – we are bound to follow their instructions);
A reversal occurring (for example, because the transaction was unauthorised);
Our determination under the PayPal Buyer Protection Policy or payment review (the process by which we review potentially high-risk transactions) that the funds received should be returned or reversed; or
You having received payment from a PayPal account holder in another country and we determine under the PayPal Buyer Protection Policy of that country that the funds received should be returned or reversed.
If you owe any amount to us, our Related Bodies Corporate or eBay you agree to allow the recovery of these amounts by debiting your account promptly if we reasonably believe that payment will not be received in full for any reason.

 

If there are insufficient funds in your PayPal account to cover any amount you owe us, our Related Bodies Corporate or eBay, the amount becomes immediately due and payable by you and you authorise us to satisfy any of these debts by:

Debiting your PayPal account at a later date;
Debiting a preferred payment method;
Setting off the credit balance of any account you have with us or any monetary liability we owe you in and towards satisfaction of your debt; or
Any other legal means.
16.3 Holds on funds, account limitation and account closure: Your PayPal account and funds in it may be subject to a hold, release amount, reserve, limitation or closure for a variety of reasons, including:

If your account is associated with another PayPal account, an account you hold with eBay, or an account connected with any other service you receive from us which has been limited, is not in good standing or poses a risk to the integrity, security or reliability of us or our systems;
If we believe your personal account is being used in connection with a business we may suspend it or require you to upgrade to a business account;
If a transaction is subject to a payment review;
Our requirements to prove your identity in accordance with Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing laws (“AML laws”);
Suspected fraud;
Sudden changes in the amount or number of transactions;
We need to ensure the integrity of a transaction;
We believe that there’s a risk associated with you or your account;
You receive a dispute, claim, chargeback or reversal in relation to any funds received into your account;
You do not meet certain seller or risk standards when listing on eBay;
You are a new seller and/or have a limited history with eBay;
Abuse of any of our services; or
Breaches of our User Agreement, Acceptable Use Policy or any other policy or agreement you have entered into with us relating to any of our services.
16.4 Matters we consider: Before holding funds or limiting your PayPal account, we consider:

Information we collect when you create your account;
Publicly available information;
Your selling activity;
Information we receive from related third parties;
Whether the funds are related to an irregular or unusual transaction; and
Other related information.
The more you use your account, the more we know about your activity. As such, our risk assessment may change and we may increase or decrease the amount of funds we hold based on that changed assessment.

16.5 How long do we hold funds?

Transaction holds and release amounts

Except in the case of a reserve or account limitation, funds are usually held for 21 days. Funds may be held for longer than 21 days if:

We believe that the increased risk associated with you or your account remains after 21 days;
If you are a seller. we expect the delivery time of your goods or services to be longer than 21 days;
You receive a dispute, claim, chargeback or reversal relating to the transaction subject to the hold; and/or
We have taken another action permitted under the PayPal User Agreement.
We may release a hold earlier than 21 days where we reasonably believe that the relevant transaction has completed successfully. Funds held for buyer disputes may not be released until we consider the issue resolved.

Reserves and limitations

If funds you receive are subject to a reserve, we will notify you how long funds will be held for at the time of setting the reserve. If access to funds is restricted because your account has been limited, you will usually gain access to those funds after the limitation has been lifted.

16.6 More information about holding funds, account limitations and closures:

Payment Review

Transactions may be subject to payment review. Funds under payment review will be subject to a hold and we will ask the seller to delay the shipping of the item.

Once we have reviewed the transaction, we will either complete or reverse the payment. If the payment is completed, we will provide notice to the seller. Otherwise, the funds will be returned to the buyer.

Transactions that complete payment review may still be reversed under the terms of the PayPal User Agreement.

Release amounts

If you are a seller, we may limit the amount you can withdraw or use from your PayPal balance to help protect us and our users from the risk of financial or other loss. The amount of your PayPal balance that will be available for withdrawal or use is called a “release amount”.

We will notify you of the terms of any release amount we apply to your account.

You may request an increase to your release amount once every 30 days.

Reserves

We may place a reserve on funds held in your account at any time where we reasonably believe there may be a higher than acceptable level of risk associated with you, your PayPal account, your business model, or your transactions. The reserve helps protect us and our users from the risk of financial or other loss.

See the PayPal User Agreement for more information on reserves.

Restoring access to a limited account

If we limit access to your account, we will investigate and attempt to resolve the issue. You may be required to provide information to us as part of our investigation. If the investigation is resolved in your favour, we will restore access to your account.

Restoring access to your account may take time and until it is restored you may not be able to use it to send, receive or withdraw funds. Please refer to the “Closing Your PayPal Account” and “Holds, Limitations and Reserves” sections of the PayPal User Agreement for a detailed explanation of when we may limit access to or close your account.

Our right to deal with held funds

You authorise us to make any reversals, refunds or payments from the held funds in accordance with the PayPal User Agreement. You will not be able to access any funds subject to a hold.

Held funds may be subject to a subsequent reversal, chargeback or claim, either while held or after the hold has been released.

Our requirement to transfer funds

If you are a judgment debtor or undischarged bankrupt, we may be required to transfer your PayPal balance to a third party to comply with a law, court order or other legal process.

Fees associated with holds, limitations or closures

You agree that you will pay us (and we may deduct from your account) any applicable fees if held funds are removed from your account in accordance with the PayPal User Agreement. For example, if you have selected that any funds received into your PayPal account should be automatically converted to another currency and the funds are subsequently refunded or reversed and must be returned to the sender in the original currency received, you will pay us (and we may deduct from your account) any fees relating to the currency conversion.

For information about fees, please see “Fees and charges” (clause 18 below).

16.7 Unavailability of our services, delays and cancellations:

Whilst we make every attempt to ensure our services are available at all times, it is possible they may be rendered temporarily unavailable from time to time.

16.8 Amounts owed to eBay:

Reimbursements to eBay for determinations under an eBay buyer protection policy

If eBay determines that you are required to reimburse eBay or your buyer, you authorise us to debit the amount of the reimbursement from your account and to pay those amounts to eBay (“eBay Reimbursement”). You will not receive a refund for your PayPal fees.

Debit process for eBay Reimbursement

We will rely on information we receive from eBay for the amount of an eBay Reimbursement.
You agree and authorise us to debit eBay Reimbursements from your account balance or from any payment method linked to your account if you set up your PayPal account as an automatic payment method for your eBay account, in our sole discretion.
If you do not want to us to debit a payment method for eBay Reimbursements, you can cancel the billing agreement from your PayPal account settings. Please note, this may affect your ability to sell on eBay. Please contact eBay for more information.
16.9 Foreign currencies: The following risks may apply when keeping foreign currency balances in your PayPal account, or where a transaction with PayPal is made in, funded by or received in a foreign currency:

Currency fluctuations

There is a risk the value of any foreign currencies in your account balance will fluctuate as exchange rates change.

Refunds

Generally, we’ll process refunds of:

online purchases and friends and family transactions to the same payment method you used for the purchase; and
in-store purchases to your PayPal balance.
 

If a payment you sent involved a currency conversion and you’re later refunded:

Within 60 days of the date of the original payment, we’ll normally use the exchange rate that we applied at the time of the original payment;
Beyond 60 days of the date of the original payment, we’ll normally use the exchange rate that applies on the date of your refund;
The refund will go back to your bank account or card used for the original transaction in the currency of the original transaction. If that is not possible, we will credit your PayPal balance in the currency of the original transaction; and
You’ll be refunded in Australian Dollars if your PayPal account balance doesn’t support the currency of the original payment.
Negative balances

If you have a negative PayPal balance in non-Australian dollars for 21 days or longer, you authorise PayPal to convert it to Australian dollars.

In addition, funds from payments received will first be diverted to us to make up any negative currency balance. We may also debit your selected payment method the next time you make a payment.

16.10 PayPal balance and the Financial Claims Scheme: As a provider of purchased payment facilities, PayPal is exempt from the Australian Government’s Financial Claims Scheme (FCS). As such, your PayPal balance is not protected by the FCS. Visit https://www.fcs.gov.au/ for more information.

Currency conversions – PayPal accounts

18.10 If PayPal converts currency, it will be completed at the transaction exchange rate we set for the relevant currency exchange. The transaction exchange rate is adjusted regularly and includes a currency conversion fee (described below) applied and retained by us on a base exchange rate to form the rate applicable to your conversion. The base exchange rate is based on rates within the wholesale currency markets on the conversion day or the prior business day; or, if required by law or regulation, set at the relevant government reference rate(s).

For some uses of your PayPal account, PayPal may determine currency conversion is necessary. For any of the following transactions that involve a currency conversion in connection with your PayPal account, the currency conversion fee is 3.5% for converting to US Dollars or Canadian Dollars, and 4.0% for converting to all other currencies:

Paying for goods or services in a currency other than the currency the goods or services are listed in.  
Sending money to a friend or family member such that they receive a different currency from the currency you pay in.
Sending money using PayPal’s Payouts or MassPay products such that your recipients receive a different currency from the currency you pay in.
 

For all other PayPal transactions involving a currency conversion, the currency conversion fee is 2.5%.

18.11 When your payment is funded by a debit or credit card and PayPal determines a currency conversion is necessary, you consent to and authorise PayPal to convert the currency in place of your debit or credit card issuer. In most cases, you may have the right to have your card issuer perform the currency conversion, if applicable for that card issuer and network. Currency preference selections may be presented to you in various forms, including a choice of which currency is used for the transaction, whether PayPal or your card issuer performs the conversion, or which conversion rate is used for the transaction, among others, and may be made available individually for each card and for each automatic payment agreement. If your card issuer convers the currency, your card issuer will determine the currency conversion rate and what fees they may charge.

18.12 PayPal will always perform the conversion for transactions where your PayPal balance or linked bank account is the payment method.

 

 


Chargeback fees

18.13 Chargeback fees are based on the currency received. Chargeback fees do not apply if the transaction is eligible for the PayPal Seller Protection Policy.

20.4 To enable us to confirm your identify, we may disclose personal information such as your name, date of birth and address to a credit reporting agency (CRA) or identity verification service to obtain an assessment of whether that personal information matches information held by the CRA or identity verification service. The CRA or identity verification service may use personal information about you and other individuals in their files to report to us on that assessment.

21. Verifying your payment method and transaction limits

Maximum amount per transaction

21.1 To help protect the integrity of our payment system, limit the risk of money laundering and terrorism financing and to prevent fraud, most customers are subject to a limit on the amount they can send or receive in a single transaction. This limit may be raised or lowered at our sole discretion to address transaction risks or if you provide additional documentation.

Unverified PayPal accounts

21.2 If your PayPal account is unverified, a lower limit is imposed on the cumulative total value of payments and monthly cumulative value of transfers you can make from your PayPal account. The amount of these limits is variable and set at our discretion. You may need to verify your account to increase these limits.

Verified PayPal accounts

21.3 We verify PayPal accounts and payment methods to safeguard your security and limit fraud. By identifying a PayPal account as ‘verified’, we are only representing that the PayPal account holder has completed the steps set out in this clause 21. By attributing a ‘verified’ status to a PayPal account, we do not guarantee, undertake or otherwise represent that they will complete a transaction or that they have satisfied any requirements under AML laws.

21.4 You cannot verify any bank account linked to your PayPal account if it is held with a financial institution in the United States of America.

21.5 If you verify your account, we will generally raise the limit on the cumulative total of payments and transfers you can make.

21.6 You can raise your sending and withdrawal limits by becoming verified.

21.7 We reserve the right to control sending and transfer limits and may require additional information from you depending on your location, credit rating and other factors.
